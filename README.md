# Some animations examples to practice

In general, what you will be able to find in this section are all the files made by me of some **Login Forms** COMPLETELY free.

You can review the code of the same and even if you wish, you could use it on your website.

**It should also be noted that the vast majority for now I have planned to do it with pure HTML & CSS, so it may not be the most optimal.
In the future I will also add some with JavaScript and more elaborate.**
